i need menu a menu  to create /view/edit branches
creating user must require branches
COLUMN NAME FOR BRANCHES  branchname,location,active,branchtype
 branchtype is retail,factory,wholesale
branches example,THRISSUR,TRIVANDRUM,TIRUNELVELI,TRICHY,MADURAI,COIMBATORE

ONCE I CLICKED THE DEPARTMENT OR BRANCHES MENU, ALL EXISTING DATA SHOULD BE PROJECTED IN SCREEN,
